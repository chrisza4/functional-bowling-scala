# functional-bowling-scala

Bowling Kata using functional programming design in Scala.

I found that pattern matching can help a lot in ensuring type safety. And also using technique "Parse, Not validated" (as in `parseFrame`)

Learn more about what is a functional programming design, and how is it diffrent from object-oriented or procedural design with me. I will write an article, blog or a presentation later.
